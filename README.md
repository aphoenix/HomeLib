# Loaning Library

## Introduction

This is a simple loaning library meant to address two needs that I have noticed
for my personal home library. First, I frequently loan books to people and then
lose track of where my books are. Second, I frequently receive gifts as books
but because I have many (thousands) I frequently receive doubles. This home
catalog will allow me to keep track of where my books are and will allow
other people to see if I already own a book.


## Roadmap

This is not what I would consider a release candidate. Here is what I would
like to include moving forward to get it to a place where it would be a useful
tool for general consumption.

- searchable
- wishlist
- ISBN integration
- multiple media (dvd, video games, cd, etc.)
- app for scanning barcodes (android poc - could also lead to monetization)
